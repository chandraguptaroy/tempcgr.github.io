    <h1> The Chinese Statue</h1>

    <p>
        <br>
        The LITTLE CHINESE STATUE was the next item to come under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction" >auction</a>eer’s hammer. Lot 103 caused those quiet murmurings that always precede the sale of a masterpiece. The auctioneer’s assistant held up the delicate piece of Ivory for the packed audience of admirers while the auctioneer glanced around the room to be sure he knew where the serious bidders were seated. I studied my catalogue and read the detailed description of the piece, and what was known of its history.
