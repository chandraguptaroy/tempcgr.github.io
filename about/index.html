            I am good at Science, Math as well as Arts. HaHa I have yet to try Commerce.<br><br>

            In future, I may opt for learning subjects like marketing, physcology, philosophy, content writing just out of curiosity not for the certificates! <br>
            
            Lastly, I learn daily with real education by MindValley to transform my life. <br>

                    <br><br>
                    Now how did I get started in all these things I am doing today? ‚Äì
                    Animation, Graphic Designing, Website development, Writing, Marketing for my YouTube channels, social
                    media, my Personal development-fitness, transformation and thinking about starting a few companies.
                    So, there will be million different variables that brought me here today to writing this ‚ÄòAbout page‚Äô,
                    but one prominent one that I would love to tell you about is my wish to improve the way education is
                    delivered, I just wished that someone made a great quality video on our syllabus eg. If the stories were
                    like movies, It would be easier to learn and remember.
                    <br><br>
                    But I knew someone wasn't coming to save us.
                </p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                    Someone tomorrow, from among us will rise up and bring this change ‚ÄìMake our education system more
                    efficient and engaging.
                    Should I wait for them? Why not me?
                    <br><br>
                    This led me to a path that has just started, but I see now that I have grown so much, I started by
                    making my YouTube channel so that I can start educating people with what I know.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I had no money, I had to start by learning what it would take to do what I wish.
                    I started learning editing, then animation.
                    <br><br>
                    I later realized that people want to look at something that looks cool.
                    But I had no money to hire a designer,
                    So, I started learning illustrator and Photoshop to make cool thumbnails and cover images.
                    <br><br>
                    Then I realized that you also need to rank on pages, and again I had no money to hire a marketing
                    agency,
                    So I started learning SEO and stuff.
                    <br><br>
                    But when I used to watch other videos where only screen recording was present, that lacked some human
                    touch. So, for recording myself, I needed to lose weight, build muscles and make a studio.
                    I have lost weight and I am building muscles and of course, no money for a studio.
                    <br><br>
                    If you have checked out my latest work, (if you haven‚Äôt checked it out here- <a href="/services/graphic-designing/">Work</a> )
                    I am going good, but yet not monetized, as I don‚Äôt know how to. I don‚Äôt want to work as a freelancer
                    just for money but to give time to my dreams and do something with it.
                    <br><br>
                    In this process, I stumbleupon things that I like, work that I can do for hours. When society around me
                    was telling me that I was not intelligent and that I have no focus (just because I didn‚Äôt like studies),
                    I could easily work on animations and graphics, without knowing hours have flown by, which helped me
                    understand myself better.‚ù§
                    <br><br>
                    I am almost 19 and I just took a loan of Rs. 500 from my brother who is 6 years younger than me and
                    bought this domain, and again since I don‚Äôt have money, I am building this site with a friend.
                    <br><br>
                    I think it would help me as a portfolio and publishing my writings which I discovered I like to do (on
                    keyboard, only).
                    <br><br>
                    Now, as I was doing all these I also had my studies and all other areas of my life, so I figured out
                    that I need productivity.
                    So, my dear search engines led me to @mindvalley, from here it started my personal growth journey and
                    they are just amazing.
                    <br><br>
                    I don‚Äôt know where I would have been today if I didn‚Äôt have that wish to improve education. Maybe or
                    maybe not I would have been typing this ‚ÄòMy story‚Äô with 55+ wpm (typing speed).
                    But today I can say that, Yes! Holy Shit. I am a much better person, I ever thought I would be.
                    <br><br>
                    Yeah! There‚Äôs so much more to grow ‚ÄìI have to start earning, I haven‚Äôt had a gf yet, so work on my
                    social skills and of course build that dream platform.
                    <br><br>
                    But Vishen (my virtual mentor) told me yesterday that we must look at our lives in a ‚ÄòReverse gap‚Äô of 5
                    to 10 years, and see how much we have grown.
                    And then make End Goals - in Experiences, Growth and Contribution. 3 IQ's That‚Äôs the way even I guess is
                    to live life.
                    <br><br>
                    I have a long road ahead of me and there are a million things to learn and do.
                    <br><br>
                    What I have today is Courage to say that <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">‚ÄîI CAN DO IT.</span>
