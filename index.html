          <h2><br>My Story<br>————</h2>
          <p>I am a Visionary. And professionally I have become many different things—Editor, Designer, Writer, Marketer etc.<br>
            I am the creator of Education Valley and Why it, and I created them with the intention to create something valuable and engaging in the field of Education.
            <br><br>
            I am from a middle class family from India and we don’t get money to spend making content, but told to just study. 
            But how could I have controlled my urge to see better quality content in the field of Education which surpasses that of Entertainment. 
            There are so many different production houses for Entertainment including some giants like Marvel, Netflix and HBO, and I love them; 
            but I see there is no such investment in Education, while there are so many students who need that.  
            <br><br>
            If I simply put it, it’s 100x times more engaging to watch Netflix movies than to study, how must we expect children to focus?
            <br><br>
            This led me to a path that has just started, but I see now that I have grown so much, I started by making my YouTube channel so that I can start educating people with what I know.
            <br><br>
            Since I had no money, I had to start by learning what it would take to do what I wish.
            I started learning editing, then animation. 
            <br><br>
            I later realized that people want to look at something that looks cool.
            But I had no money to hire a designer,<br>
            So, I started learning illustrator and Photoshop to make cool thumbnails and cover images.
            <br><br>
            Then I realized that you also need to rank on pages, and again I had no money to hire a marketing agency,
            So I started learning SEO and stuff. 
            <br><br>
            But when I used to watch other videos where only screen recording was present, that lacked some human touch. So, for recording myself,  
            I needed to lose weight, build muscles and make a studio.<br>
            I have lost weight and I am building muscles and of course, no money for a studio.<br>
